            <img src="images/me.png" class="me">
            <p class="det">During the course of Pelipaja 23k I worked with the following 4 games:</p>
            <h2>Neon Pinball</h2>
            <a href="Neon Pinball">https://sanna-juoperi.itch.io/neon-pinball</a><br>
            <img src="images/neon1.png"><img src="images/neon2.png">
            <p class="job">- With <b>Neon Pinball</b> I worked with game design, menus, UI and code. I also created the level editor, which used OpenAI API as a component.</p>
            <p class="job">- The level editor allowed the player to create their own graphics to the pinball table via text based commands, which the game sent through to OpenAI API.</p>
            <p class="job">- After processing the commands, the game received the created image from OpenAI and set it to the table elements the player had selected. The game also dealt with any errors when sending or receiving the API call.</p>
            <p class="job">- The level editor API script with nearly 300 lines of code is downloadable below:</p>

            <h2>Cat Brain Stimulator</h2>
            <a href="Cat Brain Stimulator">https://anttikarjalacentriafi.itch.io/cat-brain-stimulator</a><br>
            <img src="images/cat1.png" class="cat"><img src="images/cat2.png" class="cat">
            <p class="job">- <b>Cat Brain Stimulator</b> was a mobile centric game, which had cats as target audience.</p>
            <p class="job">- I participated in the game design and created the music and sound effects for the game. I also designed and implemented the UI and code for all the menus and audio, including audio level controls.</p>
            <p class="job">- The music and SFX were designed to be soothing for both the cat and the owner.</p>
            <p class="job">- Below a few sound clips from the game. </p>
            <p class="job">- Fish:</p><audio controls="controls"><source src="resources/Fish.wav" type="audio/x-wav" /></audio>
            <p class="job">- Fly:</p><audio controls="controls"><source src="resources/Fly.wav" type="audio/x-wav" /></audio>
            <p class="job">- Menu Music:</p><audio controls="controls"><source src="resources/MenuMusic.mp3" type="audio/x-wav" /></audio>
            <p class="job">- Game Music:</p><audio controls="controls"><source src="resources/GameMusic.mp3" type="audio/x-wav" /></audio>
            <h2>Jinglebells Rock!</h2>
            <a href="Jinglebells Rock!">https://anttikarjalacentriafi.itch.io/folly-jolly-xmash</a><br>
            <img src="images/jingle1.png"><img src="images/jingle2.png">
            <p class="job">- <b>Jinglebells Rock!</b> was a real brainchild of mine, where I destined to create an isometric shooter similar to "The Ascent" but in a humorous Christmas setting.</p>
            <p class="job">- I designed the game mechanics and wrote the game code. I also built the game environment and created the UI with a scoreboard and timer.</p>
            <p class="job">- The original design included boss rounds, powerups, dynamically changing environment and multiple different projectiles, as well as an intro and an outro animation.</p>
            <p class="job">- All the design features, including detailed graphics and fluent controls, are still being worked upon and I hope to finish them eventually.</p>
            <h2>Military Animals</h2>
            <a href="Military Animals">https://sanna-juoperi.itch.io/military-animals</a><br>
            <img src="images/mil.png" class="mil">
            <p class="job">- <b>Military Animals</b> was designed as an Age of War -clone with cute animal figures.</p>
            <p class="job">- My primary responsibility was to create the character and environment animations for the game.</p>
            <p class="job">- I also took part in creating the documentation and game design, and in the end in writing code too. I also worked on keeping the production running by attending meetings and communicating with the team.</p>
            <p class="job">- Some of my animation design can be seen below: </p>
