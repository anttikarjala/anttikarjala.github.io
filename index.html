            <p class="det">During the course of Pelipaja 23k I worked with the following 4 games:</p>
            <h2>Neon Pinball</h2>
            <img src="images/neon1.png"><img src="images/neon2.png">
            <p class="job">- With Neon Pinball I worked with game design, menus, UI and code. I also created the level editor, which used OpenAI API as a component.</p>
            <p class="job">- The level editor allowed the player to create their own graphics to the pinball table via text based commands, which the game sent through to OpenAI API.</p>
            <p class="job">- After processing the commands, the game received the created image from OpenAI and set it to the table elements the player had selected. The game also dealt with any errors when sending or receiving the API call.</p>
            <p class="job">- The level editor API script had nearly 300 lines and can be downloaded from this link: </p>
